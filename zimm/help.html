<br/>ZiMapMaker - HTML5/JavaScript application for coloring different svg 
maps using data in csv format. The main thought was to use only pure HTML5 
(without browser plugins like Flash or Silverlight). 
So, some features are not supported by all browsers
yet. Most uncommon is support of &lt;input type="color"&gt;, so <b>it's recommended 
for you to use Google Chrome or Opera (as for June 2013).</b>
<ul>
<li>
Input data. Input you data or load a file with it. Data should be in 
csv format, default separators are ';' and ',', but you can input yours. 
Line separator is CRLF (LF is acceptable but not recommended). Data must 
present some table, first column of which contains country (or some region, 
e.g. state) names, and other columns contain numeric or decimal data. Some 
first rows can contain table header. You can specify number of row from which 
country names start and number of column that contains data for visualization. 
(NB for programmers - first row/column is 1, not 0! :)). There is a button on 
this tab that loads a demo data. Another 2 text areas ('Parsed', 'Not parsed') 
are output-only and contain country/region names that was parsed (and their 
ISO3166 codes) and that wasn't, so you can edit your data to match parsing
conditions. System can't understand all of possible variants of country
names, but it surely understands its 2-character ISO 3166-1 code.

Visualization settings. Here you can
choose coloring method and map. 3 maps are available now - world (countries),
Russia (federation subjects), USA (states). Application supports 2 coloring
schemes - block and gradient. In block scheme all regions with meaning that is
in some diapason are paint with the same color. You can choose those colors and
number of them. In gradient scheme each country has its own color depending on
its data value. Color is changing little by little from one color to another.
As for now, there are 3 fixed colors - red(min value),
yellow, green(max value) between which color changes.
You can also change data intervals which are paint by the same color by enabling
checkbox 'Set my scales' (it works only for Block method).
</li><li>
After you input data and choose map
and color scheme (or accept default) you can color map by pushing
'Visualization' button. After that you can set filename and save on your disk
colored svg image. Remember that all maps have their
authors and licensed under different licenses, you can read about it in 'About'
tab.
</li></ul>
Hope you enjoy this application!
